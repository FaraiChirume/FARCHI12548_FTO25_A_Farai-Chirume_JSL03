# JSL03 Project Brief: Console-Based Task Manager

## Overview

This project involves creating a **simple task management system** where users can add **up to three new tasks** to an existing task array. Tasks are **stored as objects in an array**, each with a **unique incremental ID**. Users will enter task details via prompts, and the system will allow filtering to view only completed tasks. The project focuses on **array manipulation, user interaction via prompts and alerts, and console logging for task management**.

## Outcome

Created a functional and limited task management system that allows users to add, review, and filter tasks efficiently while maintaining tidy, well-documented, and maintainable code. Adding tasks can be done by interacting with the 'Add New Tasks' button which has been added to the HTML, CSS and JS documents.For verification, the complete list of tasks and a filtered view of 'done' tasks are logged to the browser console, demonstrating a solid foundation for future dynamic rendering and state management.
